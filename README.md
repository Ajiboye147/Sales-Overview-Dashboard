2.Furniture lags behind in both units sold and revenue shareâ€”only 13.76% of total revenue and 14K units sold.

3.Transaction failure rate (10%) is high, which could indicate issues with payment, stockouts, or order fulfillment.

4.Seasonal fluctuations are evident; March and October are high-performing months. November is consistently the lowest in both revenue and unit sales.

5.The top-selling products by unit and top revenue-generating products differ, suggesting some high-margin items sell in lower quantities.

-Improve checkout experience and add support mechanisms for pending/failed orders.

3. Capitalize on High Seasons

-Boost inventory and marketing spend during these peak months.

4. Focus on High-Margin Products

-Bundle lower-selling high-revenue products with top-volume items.

5. Revamp Underperforming Months
